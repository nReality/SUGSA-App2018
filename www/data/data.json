These tools can also be expanded to organizations that provide non traditional products such as services, information, and other types of messaging to target their audiences' needs in the right ways. One example of this is the Women in Agile movement, which started like most products do, with curiosity about a problem. Now it has grown to a non-profit organization with local groups across the world and many conference pairings under its belt all in a timeframe of a few years. Natalie will discuss the Lean Startup and Product Kata themes using Women in Agile as a case study. Learn how these product frameworks were used to expand a movement, that does not provide a physical \"product\", to get to where it is today, a global non profit with over 4000 members, and how you can take our lessons learned to nurture your curiosity, organizations, and non traditional \"product\" ideas in a successful and sustainable way.</p>\n\n<h2>LEARNING OUTCOMES</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand how to implement the Product Kata to design experiments and analyze data/metric changes in your target problems to solve</li>\n<li>Learn to apply the Lean Startup and Product Kata concepts to services and organizations/movements (versus traditional physical or software products)</li>\n<li>Articulate the Women in Agile story as a non traditional movement built and cultivated through curiosity, experimentation, and decentralization</li>\n</ul>\n",

I enjoy research and development and creating proof of concepts of new ideas and technologies. I also have experience in more low level development for more academic projects where performance was key.\n\nOver the years my experience has ranged from mobile development to creating secure communication tools; academic research projects to enterprise development more recently; working with students to helping my teams achieve their best.\n\nAll of this and \"ten-ish\" years in the industry made me who I am, a developer with interests growing towards coaching and mentoring teams.\n</p>",

They are putting companies under pressure to invest their time, energy and funds in social, environmental and governance sustainability. This aligns with the requirements of the United Nations Global Compact.\nOrganisations typically drive sustainability top down, with the executive determining, and designing, investment in sustainability measures. However, there is now a golden opportunity for companies and employees to be partners in sustainable transformation.\nDecentralising the decision-making power enables employees to become co-designers in the sustainability masterplan. The value-based desires of the employees are served simultaneously with their career aspirations. And the buy-in for legitimate implementation increases.\nIf you have been wondering “what role can I play in increasing sustainability; in society, in my work, in the world?” this keynote will inspire you and stimulate ideas you can action.\n</p>",
